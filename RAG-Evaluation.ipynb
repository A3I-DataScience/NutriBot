These prognostic factors could be used to reinforce/support existing criteria and to \\nidentify additional criteria that are associated with increased risk that could trigger a decision for referral to inpatient care. \\nThe GDG completed an online survey (before the GDG meetings for this recommendation) to determine minimally important \\nabsolute risk thresholds for each important outcome in infants and children 6-59 months with severe wasting and/or \\nnutritional oedema, defined as the smallest change in the outcome regarded by the majority of health workers as \\nmeaningful.
