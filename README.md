# NutriBot

This repository contains the code developed by [A3I-Data Science](https://a3i-datascience.github.io/) at the occasion of a dataton proposed by [Datais](https://www.datais.es/dataton-sostenibilidad) in Madrid in November 2024.


## Acknowledgment

* This flask has been developed using this template https://github.com/arora-r/chatapp-with-voice-and-openai-outline.

## Project Scope

Optimization of nutritional diets with Generative AI

The objective of this challenge is to develop a model and an application using generative AI to optimize nutritional diets, guaranteeing a balanced and adequate intake for different populations. Participants will need to address the design of solutions that not only promote health, but are also customizable and accessible, taking into account the preferences and nutritional needs of users.

Projects will be evaluated based on the effectiveness of the model in creating balanced diets, innovation in the use of generative AI, the usability of the developed application and the clarity of the presentation of results. It is recommended to use the following data sets: Apparent Intake (based on household consumption and expenditure surveys) and Suite of Food Security Indicators 2.

## Evaluation

You will have a maximum of 20 minutes to present your project, followed by a round of questions from the jury.

### Evaluation Criteria

These are the points on which the evaluation of your project will be based:

#### Quality of the Technical Solution (up to 40 points)

Innovation in the solution and approach to address the sustainability problem.
Feasibility and scalability of the solution in the real world.
Coverage of the complete data cycle: collection, analysis, integration and generation of insights.
Implementation of Machine Learning & AI.

#### Business Impact (up to 40 points)

Relevance and applicability of the solution for the sustainability sector and its recipients.
Ability to solve the problem in practice and potential to improve processes.
User Experience (UX) focused on ease of use, clarity in presentation of results and applicability.
Process improvement through technology and data for sustainable optimization.

#### Presentation and Defense (up to 20 points)

Quality and originality of the presentation and clarity of the message.
Clarity and effectiveness in the visualization of results.
Power of the message and ability to convince the jury.
